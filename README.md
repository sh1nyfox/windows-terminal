My Windows Terminal color schemes and settings. Now added basic neovim config file (it's nothing fancy)

To use on your Windows Terminal copy the contents of [settings.json](https://github.com/sh1nyfox/windows-terminal/blob/master/settings.json) into your own terminal.

To use the neovim config, make sure you have the "nvim" folder inside ~/.config and paste the file there.
